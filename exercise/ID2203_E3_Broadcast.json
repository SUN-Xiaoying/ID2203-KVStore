Some components such as `PerfectLink`,  `Network` and `Timer` are already provided. No need to implement them.\n2. Execute the imports defined below **before** compiling your component implementations.\n3. We recommend making use of the component state and internal messages we have provided, if any, to complete the implementation logic.\n4. You can always print messages to the output log, from within handlers to see what happens during the simulation. e.g. `println(s\"Process $self delivers message $msg\");`\n5. Remember that during the simulation check you can print and observe the simulation time, i.e. with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n5. Do not forget to run the checker code block after each component implementation to ensure that all properties are satisfied before exporting and submitting the notebook.\n6.

**provides** the following port *(already imported in the notebook)*.\n\n    class ReliableBroadcast extends Port {\n      indication[RB_Deliver];\n      request[RB_Broadcast];\n    }\n    \nAn **RB** component should request `RB_Broadcast` and indicate `RB_Deliver` events, as defined below:\n\n    case class RB_Deliver(source: Address, payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\n    case class RB_Broadcast(payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\n       \n\nAs you have already learnt from the course lectures, Reliable Broadcast adds the `Agreement` property into the already existing properties of Best-Effort Broadcast:\n\n1. Validity:  *If a correct process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m.*\n2. No duplication: *No message is delivered more than once.*\n3. No creation: *If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s.*\n4. **Agreement**: *If a message m is delivered by some correct process, then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.*\n\nHINT: The recommended algorithm to use in this assignment is *Eager Reliable Broadcast* and is described in page 2 within the following  [document](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/6c144fd806b3568f6e2c5d7d03e27a29/asset-v1:KTHx+ID2203.1x+2016T3+type@asset+block/reliablebroadcast.pdf) in the respective lecture.\n\n**Mind that, to complete this part, you will first have to implement and test Best-Effort Broadcast, defined

<em>(already imported in the notebook)</em>.</p>\n<pre><code>class ReliableBroadcast extends Port {\n  indication[RB_Deliver];\n  request[RB_Broadcast];\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An <strong>RB</strong> component should request <code>RB_Broadcast</code> and indicate <code>RB_Deliver</code> events, as defined below:</p>\n<pre><code>case class RB_Deliver(source: Address, payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\ncase class RB_Broadcast(payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you have already learnt from the course lectures, Reliable Broadcast adds the <code>Agreement</code> property into the already existing properties of Best-Effort Broadcast:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Validity: <em>If a correct process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m.</em></li>\n  <li>No duplication: <em>No message is delivered more than once.</em></li>\n  <li>No creation: <em>If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s.</em></li>\n  <li><strong>Agreement</strong>: <em>If a message m is delivered by some correct process, then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>HINT: The recommended algorithm to use in this assignment is <em>Eager Reliable Broadcast</em> and is described in page 2 within the following <a

adds the `Causal Delivery` property into the already existing properties of Reliable and Best-Effort Broadcast:\n\n1. Validity:  *If a correct process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m.*\n2. No duplication: *No message is delivered more than once.*\n3. No creation: *If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s.*\n4. Agreement: *If a message m is delivered by some correct process, then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.*\n5. **Causal delivery**: *For any message m1 that potentially caused a message m2, i.e., m1 → m2, no process delivers m2 unless it has already delivered m1.*\n\nHINT: The recommended algorithm to use in this assignment is *Waiting Causal Broadcast* and is described in page 4 within the following  [document](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/f11d45d4cb0d9685c723dd00de427b8d/asset-v1:KTHx+ID2203.1x+2016T3+type@asset+block/causalbroadcast.pdf) in the respective lecture.\n\n**Also mind, that to complete this part, you will first have to implement and test Best-Effort Broadcast and Reliable Broadcast, defined above.**\n\n\n#### Working with Vector Clocks ####\nWe have already provided you a `VectorClock` data structure **(already imported)** to aid you with the algorithm implementation. You can briefly see the supported operations below:\n\n```scala\n    case class VectorClock(var vc: Map[Address, Int]) {\n        def inc(addr: Address) : Unit  //increases the clock corresponding to the address @addr provided\n        def set(addr: Address, value: Int) : Unit //sets the clock of @addr to @value\n        def <=(that: VectorClock): Boolean   //returns true if this vector clock instance is lower or equal to @that\n    }\n    object VectorClock {\n        def empty(topology: scala.Seq[Address]): VectorClock //generates a vector clock that has an initial clock value of 0 for each address in the @topology provided\n        def apply(that: VectorClock): VectorClock //copy constructor of a vector clock. E.g. if vc1 is a vector clock vc2 = VectorClock(vc1) is a copy of vc1\n    }\n```\nIn case you want to check the full implementation of the VectorClock, you can find it in our full published gist [here](https://gist.github.com/senorcarbone/5c960ee27a67ec8b6bd42c33303fdcd2).\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2021-02-10T09:34:00+0000","config":{"tableHide":false,"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","colWidth":12,"editorHide":true,"fontSize":9,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h3>Part III: Causal-Order Reliable Broadcast</h3>\n<p>A Causal-Order Reliable Broadcast Abstraction (CRB), in Kompics terms, is a component that <strong>provides</strong> the following port <em>(already imported in the notebook)</em>.</p>\n<pre><code>class CausalOrderReliableBroadcast extends Port {\n  indication[CRB_Deliver];\n  request[CRB_Broadcast];\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A <strong>CRB</strong> component should request <code>CRB_Broadcast</code> and indicate <code>CRB_Deliver</code> events, as defined below:</p>\n<pre><code>case class CRB_Deliver(src: Address, payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\ncase class CRB_Broadcast(payload: KompicsEvent) extends KompicsEvent;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you have already learnt from the course lectures, Causal-Order Reliable Broadcast adds the <code>Causal Delivery</code> property into the already existing properties of Reliable and Best-Effort Broadcast:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Validity: <em>If a correct process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m.</em></li>\n  <li>No duplication: <em>No message is delivered more than once.</em></li>\n  <li>No creation: <em>If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s.</em></li>\n  <li>Agreement: <em>If a message m is delivered by some correct process, then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.</em></li>\n  <li><strong>Causal delivery</strong>: <em>For any message m1 that potentially caused a message m2, i.e., m1 → m2, no process delivers m2 unless it has already delivered m1.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>HINT: The recommended algorithm to use in this assignment is <em>Waiting Causal Broadcast</em> and is described in page 4 within the following <a href=\"https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/f11d45d4cb0d9685c723dd00de427b8d/asset-v1:KTHx+ID2203.1x+2016T3+type@asset+block/causalbroadcast.pdf\">document</a> in the respective lecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Also mind, that to complete this part, you will first have to implement and test Best-Effort Broadcast and Reliable Broadcast, defined above.</strong></p>\n<h4>Working with Vector Clocks</h4>\n<p>We have already provided you a <code>VectorClock</code> data structure <strong>(already imported)</strong> to aid you with the algorithm implementation.
